### The Pandemic Data

We use pandemic data from Our World in Data (OWD) [(Webpage)[https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data];(Github)[https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data] based at Oxford University. (Ritchie et. al. 2020)  The pandemic data is constituted of daily total-cases data and new-cases data (See full codebook[https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data-codebook.md] from the source data) in the United States and Globally (See (Source Information by Country)[https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country]) from January to the end of June 2020. The first corona-virus case was found on January 20, so we take this date as the start point of the pandemic in the United States.
