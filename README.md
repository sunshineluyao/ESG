### Data Duration
This study focuses mainly on the period of January to June 2020, during which, COVID-19 spread to Europe and North America, and the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic.


### The Stock Data
We requested financial data of companies listed in [S&P 1000](https://www.money-zine.com/definitions/investing-dictionary/sp-1000-index/) from [FACTSET] (https://www.factset.com/products-data), a financial data supplier. The variables we used for analysis include daily closing price, market value, and MSCI ESG rating score (MSCI, 2020). This list is a comprehensive representation of companies publicly traded in the U.S. since it accounts for 90% of total market capitalization and covers all the Fama-French 30 industries. 

### The Pandemic Data

We use pandemic data from Our World in Data (OWD) ([[Webpage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)]; [[Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)]) based at Oxford University. (Ritchie et. al. 2020)  The pandemic data is constituted of daily total-cases data and new-cases data (See [full codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data-codebook.md) from the source data) in the United States and Globally (See [Source Information by Country](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country)) from January to the end of June 2020. The first corona-virus case was found on January 20, so we take this date as the start point of the pandemic in the United States.
